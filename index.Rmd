#### About


I am a Research Biostatistician in the [Division of Biostatistics & Epidemiology](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) of Department of Healthcare Policy & Research at Weill Cornell Medicine.


I received a MS in biostatistics from [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/population-health/research/biostatistics) in 2018. Prior to that, I received a BA in Economics from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2015.

In my free time, I like to play and coach table tennis.
